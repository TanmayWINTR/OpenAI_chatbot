# Real Estate Pro Chatbot

This project provides a template for creating a chatbot using OpenAI's GPT model and Gradio. It's designed to be a user-friendly interface for real estate investment and negotiation advice, but can be customized for various other applications. Users can interact with a GPT-powered chatbot, receiving insights and responses to a wide range of queries.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up and running your own instance of the chatbot on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have Python installed on your system. This application requires Python 3.6 or later.

### Installation

1. **Install OpenAI Package**

   Install the OpenAI Python package, necessary for interacting with the OpenAI API:

   ```bash
   pip install openai==0.28.1
   ```

2. **Install Gradio**

   Install Gradio, which is used to create the web interface for the chatbot:

   ```bash
   pip install gradio
   ```

### Configuration

- **API Key**: An OpenAI API key is required. Replace `'your-api-key'` in the code with your actual OpenAI API key.
- **Customizing the Chatbot Role**: Customize the chatbot's role and expertise by modifying the `messages` variable. This allows you to tailor the chatbot for different use cases.

  Example:
  ```python
  messages = [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a financial expert specializing in real estate investment and negotiation. You answer the financial questions in less than 20 words."}]
  ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Application**

   Run the Python script containing the chatbot code.

2. **Access the Interface**

   A URL will be displayed in the terminal. Click on this URL to open the Gradio interface in your web browser.

3. **Interact with the Chatbot**

   Begin interacting with the chatbot by typing in your queries.
